# micro-parse

Tiny parser combinator library in Haskell.

This library was written for educational purposes and is
missing basic functionality, such as good error handling, escaping etc.

In the [examples](examples) folder, there are examples of using micro-parse to write parsers. Currently, the examples include:

- [A simple JSON parser](examples/JSON.hs)
- [A simple calculator implementation](examples/Calc.hs)
