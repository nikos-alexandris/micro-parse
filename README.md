# micro-parse

Tiny parser combinator library in Haskell.

This library was written for educational purposes and is
missing basic functionality, such as good error handling, escaping etc.

In the [examples](https://github.com/nikos-alexandris/micro-parse/tree/main/examples) folder, there are examples of using micro-parse to write parsers. Currently, the only example is a JSON parser.
